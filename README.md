# Harry Potter Hangman Game
### A hangman style word guessing game themed after the Harry Potter book / movie series

#### 05//04/18 - Scott Johnson

## Project Goal
The Harry Potter Hangman Game demonstrates the use of JavaScript key events for capturing a user's 'guesses' and then executing through a sequence of logic steps to determine if the user has guessed a correct letter until which time the user either runs out of guesses or guesses all of the correct letters in the word.

## Project Usefulness
This project incorporates JavaScript learnings in many areas such as for loops, function calls, if / else statements, and placement of HTML through the use of id tags.

## Help, Support, and Maintenance
Users can reach out to me (sjohnson.wvu@gmail.com) for support as I'm the sole contributor to this project.
